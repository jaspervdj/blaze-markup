* 0.6.0.0 Started changelog

- use new bytestring builder (bytestring > 0.10.0.0)
- single-quotes are no longer escaped  (blaze-markup > 0.6.0.0)
- double-quotes are escaped using &#34; instead of &quot;
- allow direct embedding of decimally encoded Int's and Integer's
  in Markup. This avoids an unnecessary intermediate conversion to String's
  and gains some additional performance.
